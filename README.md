# Compost Mates

## Description
Welcome to Compost Mates. It makes composting more convenient and accessible for households. 

Before users are logged in, they are only able to see the welcome page that will have a carousel of images and a list of what can and cannot be composted when they hover each image.

Once users create an account, they are able to see a list of composts they have previously scheduled for pickup in the My Compost Page. In addition, the Single Compost view, will show the users what types of food wastes are included for that particular compost, and if they need to update it to include more or less food wastes, they will have the ability to do so.

Furthermore, the Compost Form, allows users to schedule their compost by naming it, specifying the amount of compost, and detailing which food wastes will be included.

Compost Mates gives users the solution to composting conveniently. They will have the ability to schedule pick up in order to not deal with the smell of decaying food at home, while also saving time so they do not have to take time out of their day to drop off their food waste at a drop off location.
